# SpoolmanSync - Pre-built Docker Images
#
# This compose file uses pre-built images from GitHub Container Registry.
# For users who prefer Docker Hub, replace ghcr.io/gibz104 with docker.io/gibz104
#
# Choose a profile based on your setup:
#
#   Embedded Home Assistant (recommended for most users):
#     docker compose -f docker-compose.prebuilt.yml --profile embedded up -d
#
#   External Home Assistant (if you already have HA with ha-bambulab):
#     docker compose -f docker-compose.prebuilt.yml --profile external up -d
